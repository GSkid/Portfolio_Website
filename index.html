			<h2 id="about-header">About Grant<h2>
			<p>Grant is a 22 year-old, aspiring software engineer with a passion for learning and knack for quickly picking up new skills. He currently lives in the California Bay Area and is activley searching for a job. He recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz in June 2020 with a B.S. in Bioengineering, although most of his work was done working with software and electronics. He also enjoys public speaking and found a niche in the university as a student instructor, where (for 3 years) Grant taught the university's largest-ever student-taught class, reaching up to 140 students, which focused primarily on public speaking. That was one of the defining parts of his time at university and a way to express himself in a completely unique way.<br><br>In his free time, Grant enjoys cooking, working on creative projects, exploring new and hidden locations, and golfing. Grant was one of the two captains for the Deep Cliff Golf Course high-school team where he worked and won the championship both years he played. He grew rusty due to the lack of time in school at Santa Cruz but hopes to improve again in the future.<br><br>In terms of physical activities, Grant plays nearly every sport. The extensive list includes the aformentioned golf as well as baseball, basketball, soccer, football, tennis, and skiing (to name a few). In high school, Grant was on both the JV and Varsity baseball teams as a starting 3rd baseman and relief pitcher. However, due to unfortunate injuries his senior year, Grant was unable to play except for a single game. Regardless, it was a great experience to play with existing friends and make new ones in the process.</p>
