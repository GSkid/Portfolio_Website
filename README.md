# Portfolio_Website
This is the HTML and CSS code used to make my website portfolio. It's still a work in progress and I only started learning HTML and CSS in the middle of August 2020, so any help or feedback is appreciated! (Not looking JS help yet, that will come later)

I'm still debating if I want to buy a domain, that'll probably happend eventually, but I want to complete the website before then. Currently, I am in the process of setting up the content of the website and am finished through the first project. I still have at least 1 more project I want to include, preferably 2 more, and then I will move on to the online resume portion of the site. This portion will list out my skills and experience, similar to a standard resume. For the final portion, hobbies, I plan to include my hobby activities which include stuff about my car, golf, exploration, and maybe some video game stuff. Problem is, I'm not very good at the video games and so I don't have much to show for it, but I enjoy playing them so might as well include it anyway. Regardless, that is the section I am most looking forward to so I'm saving it for the end, sort of as a reward to myself for finishing.
